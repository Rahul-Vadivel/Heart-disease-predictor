Heart Disease Prediction System
This project is a full-stack web application that predicts the risk of heart disease using machine learning and displays results through an intuitive, healthcare-themed user interface.

The backend is built with Python and Flask and uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on key health parameters including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more. The predictive model delivers accurate binary classification for heart disease risk.

The frontend features a modern, responsive multipage website designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including smooth animations and interactive charts powered by Chart.js. Users can input personal health data on the prediction page and receive customized risk assessments with practical health recommendations.

Key features include:

Machine learning powered prediction via Random Forest algorithm

Training using the UCI Heart Disease dataset or user-provided data

Dynamic risk visualization and probability breakdown

Responsive design with a professional healthcare color scheme

Integration of model predictions and frontend results with live updates

This project aims to provide accessible, real-time heart disease risk evaluation to promote early detection and preventive healthcare.
